# Basic Ransomware

## Overview

`Basic_ransomware` is a simple ransomware simulation project developed in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI). The project demonstrates basic ransomware functionality in a controlled and educational environment. It searches and encrypts files only within a predefined restricted area, ensuring no unintended files or directories are affected.

## Features

- **GUI Interface**: Interact with the ransomware through a user-friendly graphical interface.
- **File Search and Encryption**: Searches and encrypts files only within a restricted area.
- **Decryption**: Provides a mechanism to decrypt files back to their original state.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Basic_ransomware.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd Basic_ransomware
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries. If you have a `requirements.txt` file, install the dependencies with:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the ransomware simulation:

1. **Run the GUI application**:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Use the GUI** to select the restricted area and choose files for encryption or decryption. The interface will guide you through the process.

## Examples

- **Encrypt files**: Select the restricted area and use the provided options in the GUI to encrypt files.
- **Decrypt files**: Use the decryption feature in the GUI to restore files to their original state.

## Safety and Ethical Use

This project is designed purely for educational purposes. It is crucial to understand the implications of ransomware and to use this code responsibly. **Never** use this code on real, important files or in any manner that could cause harm.

**Warning**: Be extremely careful when running this code. Although the functionality is limited to a restricted area, there is always a risk of unintended consequences. **I am not responsible for any loss or damage to your files or data**. Ensure you have backups and only run this code in a controlled environment.
